# chintabid
Chintabid is a digital learning platform designed for Bengali-speaking students in Bangladesh and India, focusing on skills essential for the modern digital economy. The platform will deliver high-quality Bengali-language courses on programming, app and web development, digital marketing, AI, data engineering, cybersecurity, and other career-oriented fields.
The goal of Shikhon is to make industry-standard education accessible, affordable, and language-inclusive for university and college students who aspire to become freelancers, entrepreneurs, and professionals in global markets.
Unlike existing global e-learning platforms such as Udemy or Coursera—where content is predominantly in English and priced in foreign currencies—Shikhon will localize both content and commerce for the Bengali-speaking population. Courses will be created and taught by a network of university professors, international students, experienced freelancers, and industry managers.
